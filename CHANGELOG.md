# Changelog

All notable changes to BubbleVillagers will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.2] - 2026-01-08

### ✨ Added
- Added `/villageroptimizer clearglow` admin subcommand to remove glow from optimized villagers in loaded chunks.
- Added `/villageroptimizer glow <on|off>` admin subcommand to enable/disable optimized villager glow at runtime.
- Added two new config-driven auto-optimization modes:
  - Auto-optimize when a chunk exceeds a villager population threshold.
  - Auto-optimize when a trade hall (radius) reaches a villager population threshold.

### 🔄 Changed
- When enabled, optimized villager glow is now applied for already-optimized villagers in loaded chunks and newly loaded chunks (not only at the moment of optimization).

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed “optimized villagers stay glowing after restart” when the outline feature is disabled by clearing glow on startup/chunk-load.

### 🧪 Testing
- Added MockBukkit-based tests for plugin lifecycle and key optimization/glow behaviors.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-01-08

### 🐛 Fixed
- Fixed `ClassCastException` on some Paper builds when reading `gameplay.restock-optimized-trades.restock-times` (e.g. `Integer` vs `Long`) which could error when right-clicking optimized villagers.
